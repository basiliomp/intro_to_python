# OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)
###################################

# Any software program, is susceptible to be considered as an object.
# Each object has some attributes or features related to it.
# Those attributes can be different across specific examples (implementations) of the object.

# Class and objects
# A class is the abstraction of the object written in the software, while the object
# is the specific, existing object.

# Imagine a bank account as the class we are trying to abstract and program.
# What are the attributes of the bank account?
# Bank accounts can be defined acording to their date of creation, id, client id,
# balance, currency, account activity, and the possibility of attachment of the account (embargo).
# This class 'bank account' is the template for the different objects.

# Additionally, the class bank account we are trying to abstract for programming
# will need some functions in order to be useful. A proper bank account should 
# allow a functionality to be created and removed, then a way to be able to 
# receive money, transfer money, check the balance, check the account activity,
# and finally to offer some analysis of our account activity.

# In OOP atributes are the features defining the object, and shall not be accessible
# nor editable from outside the object. The way to interact with objects is through
# the methods. We can think of attributes as variables, and methods as functions.

# Other programming paradigms are:
# Imperative (sequential running), functional (scala, Haskel) or declarative (SQL).
# The task of designing classes, objects, and so on, is 'Software Engineering',
# a branch of Information Technologies.
